# _Independent Project Week 4_

#### _Intro, Week 4, *06.21.2019*_

## Description
_This site was created to demonstrate skills learned in JavaScript. The user should be able to put in a custom order for pizza and get a returned value._

## Site Design

_I wanted to make this site feel like a real world application that you would visit. Portland is full of local businesses and it was important to convey that in my design._
